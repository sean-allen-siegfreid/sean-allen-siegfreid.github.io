## Urban Informatics
This blog is dedicated for one of my classes called Urban Informatics and Sustainable Design.

It is very interesting so far because in the first half of the class, we talk about how urban ecology works and how it affects the living environment of urban areas. For the second half, we will focus more on the urban informatics side which is more a part of my expertiser since it's computation.
